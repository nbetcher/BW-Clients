 * Optional banner rendered at the top of the cipher view. Hosts that surface a
 * privileged-access feature (currently the web vault) provide the banner component
 * class through this token; platforms without it (browser, desktop, emergency access)
 * leave it unprovided, so the cipher view injects `null` and renders nothing.
 *
 * The token holds the component CLASS — `cipher-view` renders it with
 * `NgComponentOutlet`, passing the `cipher` (a `CipherView`, `partial` when the server
 * gated it) as a single input — so `libs/vault` needs no dependency on the feature
 * library that implements the banner.
